\value{
A list with observed name of the fitted model family degrees of freedom and observed and fitted marginal frequencies.

\description{
A function that given a fitted \code{singleR} class object
computed marginal frequencies by as sum of probability density functions
for each unit in data at each point i.e. kth element of marginal frequency
table is given by \mjteqn{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{obs}}Pr(Y_{j}=k|\eta_{j})}{
\sum_{j=1}^{N_{obs}}\mathbb{P}(Y_{j}=k|\eta_{j})}{}.
For k=0 only (if specified at call) they are computed as
\mjteqn{\hat{N}-N_{obs}}{\hat{N}-N_{obs}}{} because
\mjteqn{\boldsymbol{f}_{0}}{\boldsymbol{f}_{0}}{} is assumed to
the unobserved part of the studied population.

These frequencies are useful in diagnostics for count data regression, such
as assessment of fit.
